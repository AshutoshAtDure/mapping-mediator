The OpenHIM Mediator Mapping is a tool with various uses to meet a range of common bushiness use cases.

The main concept behind the OpenHIM Mediator Mapping is to simplify the creation of business logic without having the need to get developers involved in creating these business flows.

It allows a non technical person to define some configuration and allow the OpenHIM Mediator Mapping to do the heavy lifting.

Some of the features the OpenHIM Mediator Mapping caters for are as follows
  - Content Negotiation
  - Validation
  - Transformation
  - Data manipulations
  - External requests
  - State management

What makes the OpenHIM Mediator Mapping so powerful is that it can be used for a wide range of use cases, ranging from the very basic of ensuring data quality by using the validation mechanism, or more complex use cases where it performs data validation, external lookups, data transformation and manipulations. 

Even more complex workflows can be configured by allowing `endpoints` to call other `endpoints` and chaining them together to achieve a desired workflow.
